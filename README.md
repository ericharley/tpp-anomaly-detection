# Detecting Anomalous Event Sequences with Temporal Point Processes
Pytorch implementation of the paper ["Detecting Anomalous Event Sequences with Temporal Point Processes"](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/6faa8040da20ef399b63a72d0e4ab575-Abstract.html), by Oleksandr Shchur, Ali Caner Turkmen, Tim Januschowski, Jan Gasthaus, and Stephan GÃ¼nnemann, NeurIPS 2021.


## Installation
1. Install the dependencies
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
2. Activate the conda environment
    ```
    conda activate anomaly_tpp
    ```
3. Install the package (this command must be run in the `tpp-anomaly-detection` folder)
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```
4. Unzip the data
    ```
    unzip data.zip
    ```
